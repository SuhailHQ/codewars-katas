Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
[1, -2, 3, -4, 5] --> [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
[] --> []
Notes:
All values are greater than INT_MIN
The input should be modified, not returned.
